Classic Snake Game

This is a classic snake game I wrote in C.
It thought me basic use of array pointers and function arguments in C.

You turn with the a, w, s, d keys. You must be in lowercase. The head is an 8 and the rest of the body is 0s.

You can pause the game with p, and therminate it with t.

Have fun!
