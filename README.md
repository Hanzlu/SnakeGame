# SnakeGame
Classic Snake Game

This is a classic snake game I wrote in C.
It thought me basic use of array pointers and function arguments in C.

I provide you with both the code and a compiled executable program.

You turn with the a, w, s, d keys. You must be in lowercase. The head is an 8 and the rest of the body is 0s.

Have fun!
